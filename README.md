Research into Heathkit's 1983 kit robot. Especially with my ETW-18, I purchased in September 2023.

## What is here

Media and documentation for the Heathkit ET-18 (Hero-1) wheeled robot.

## Why is this especially interesting

Working with Rodney implies some form of RJ to ease into development. At least this is the idea.

## An experiment to contain mathematical expressions in here

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

### Saves the day

That group is cool. And at a good price too.
