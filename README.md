Research into Heathkit's 1983 kit robot

## What is here

Media and documentation for the Heathkit ET-18 (Hero-1) wheeled robot.

## Why is this so interesting

Working with Rodney implies some form of RJ to ease into development. At least this is the idea.

## The community

The one of the only groups left [here](https://groups.io/g/hero-owners).

## An experiment to contain mathematical expressions in here

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

### Fucking asshole

Ordered the RF remote kit and was shorted the logic board. Fucking fags.
