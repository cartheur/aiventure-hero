## Upgrades to the ETW-18

There are two options to add:

* ![image](/upgrades/images/hero-usb.png)
USB 2.0 interface

* ![image](/upgrades/images/hero-rf-module.png)
RF Module Card
* ![image](/upgrades/images/hero-rf-remote.png)
RF Handheld Unit

That have a dependency upon this requisite:

* ![image](/upgrades/images/hero-memory-expanse.png)
Memory expanion unit
* ![image](/upgrades/images/hero-utility-rom.png)
Utility ROM
