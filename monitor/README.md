## Sources for the monitor program

Files that are located in this directory contain the source code for the Hero-1 robot. I have found them scattered across the Internet, circa 2001 and before.

### What is here

* Hero-1 Memory Dump
    This program creates a formatted memory dump of the specified range of HERO-1 memory addresses on a terminal connected to the robot's serial port. It requires that the robot have HERO-1 BASIC, memory expansion with at least 8K ram, and the serial port.
* Symbolic Macro Assembler
    SMAL Hero is a symbolic macro assembly language for the Heathkit Hero-1 robot. The assembler accepts the standard mnemonics for the Motorola 6800 instruction set, as well as a set of special extended mnemonics for the Hero-1 Robot Control Language interpreter. In addition to providing the basic assembly functions the SMAL Hero assembler provides a powerful macro facility and a linkage editor facility supporting separate assembly, subprogram libraries, and shared common blocks. Assembler and linker output may be either absolute or relocatable, and the object language is encoded in an easily interpreted textual form.
* Hero-1 C Compiler
    A C cross compiler for the Hero-1 with cource.
