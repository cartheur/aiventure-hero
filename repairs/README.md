## Repairs to the ETW-18

A series of repairs to bring an old robot back to everyday life. And to help study [Heiserman](https://github.com/cartheur/aiventure-rodney)'s concept of self-programming, given a new embodiment criteria in [ideal](https://github.com/cartheur/ideal).

* The current dilemma is to pivot the robot on its back wheels, keeping the drive wheel elevated so it can be tested with the training/programming unit
