an eBay auction to end all others (really?)

This was my fathers Heathkit ETW-18, His name was James R. Huston, he passed away in August of 2019 with my Mother following in March of 2021

He was the 25th Employee at Apple Computer and used to have a store on eBay under the name EarlyApple but for some reason I can't find it any more.

I am selling this unit AS-IS (No Returns Accepted), I do not know if it still functions, but I do know it has been in clean dry storage for the better part of 25+ years. From what I can see, there is no visible damage to any surfaces, panels, or accessories. It does have a power supply and a remote, along with various manuals and schematic's of the boards and a baggie of extra panel screws. Please look through the pictures for all items included and don't hesitate to ask me any questions and I will do my best to answer them to the best of my ability. Will only be able to ship to the lower 48 United States. This shipping price is only an estimate and anything less than $175.00 will be refunded. 

Thanks for looking!

-James H.
